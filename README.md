# Worlds-Hardest-Game

This is a copy of the hilariously frustrating world's hardest game. Unfortunately, the younger version of myself never had the motivation to finish it so it is only equipped with the first level. Nevertheless, if you would like to check it out, then feel free to follow the GitHub or Replit links!

Note, if you are trying to download and run the game, you're going to need to install Python and Pygame then you're going to have to run "Worlds's Hardest Game.py"
